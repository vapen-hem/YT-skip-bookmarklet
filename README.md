# YT-skip-bookmarklet
Instantly skip YouTube ads, no adblock, no extensions, only tested on Chrome so far

Steps

* Copy everything in the file.
* Right click on the bookmarks bar, then click "add new page"(No idea if it says that exactly, my chrome is not in english)
* Remove what ever is in the URL text bar, and then paste the code onto there.
* Name it YT skip(Or something else, it does not matter)
* When a ad shows up, press the book mark, and it will skip the ad

Not my code, no idea who made it, I saw it in a video and just copied the code on screen.
